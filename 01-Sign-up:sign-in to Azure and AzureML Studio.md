# Chapter 1 â€“ Getting things ready: Sign-up/sign-in to Azure and AzureML Studio

First of all, an Azure subscription is a pre-requisite for this Instructor Led Lab. You can use your internal account, MSDN subscription or a free trial ( [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)) to complete this lab.

Once we have our Azure subscription set up, we also need to create our Azure ML workspace and sign in to the tool:

1. Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace on the Azure subscription:

2. Select the workspace name, location, the storage account to be used, and the service plan tier to deploy the experiment web service after its creation:

3. Now, you can find the 3 resources on the resource group in which they have been created:

5. This is the first view of the Azure ML online tool, an empty list of experiments. Note that the region that you selected as a location for the workspace is the start of the url, and you can also browse for different regions or workspaces on the top bar:
